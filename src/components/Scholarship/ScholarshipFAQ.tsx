          Who is this scholarship for?
        </h1>
        <p className="text-lg">
          Each year, this endowed scholarship will award one student $1k, qualifying it for
          &quot;competitive scholarship&quot; status. This means that if you are an out of state or
          international student, you may receive in-state tuition for that year. For this reason, we
          highly encourage these demographics to apply. In addition to academic excellence,
          applicants will be preferred if they have demonstrated engagement with any CS student
          organization at UTD. Note that the scholarship is awarded by a committee appointed by the
          Jonsson school, and not ACM UTD or Prof. John Cole (our faculty sponsor). Please do not
          get in touch with us on questions regarding this scholarship.

          What inspired the scholarship?
        </h1>
        <p className="text-lg">
          Our scholarship was inspired by the actions and leadership of Gopal Gupta (CS Dept Head
          2009-2020). During this time, the department grew immensely and is now the 3rd largest CS
          department in the United States. In addition to fostering a culture of undergraduate
          academic excellence, Dr. Gupta placed a large importance on the role of student
          organizations within the department and the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and
          Computer Science more broadly. One graded assignment for all incoming freshmen in CS is
          that they attend an event outside of class where they must talk to representatives from
          many CS student organizations. Furthermore, Dr. Gupta encouraged students to listen in on
          department meetings, provide feedback on programs within the department, and present goals
          and events to faculty members. Finally, Dr. Gupta initiated efforts to start HackUTD, a
          university hackathon, which has grown to be one of the largest in the U.S.
