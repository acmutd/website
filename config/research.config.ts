Using the ThermoMutDB dataset of over 13,000 mutations we engineered a rich feature space to capture physiochemical, evolutionary, and 3D structural characteristics. With this dataset we developed a custom voting ensemble that utilized random forests, gradient boosting and SVM classifiers, which outperformed Siamese Neural Networks by 23% in classifying stabilizing vs destabilizing mutations. Our approach generalized well over a diverse set of protein families and also improved the interpretability of a reliable and faster mutation based discovery model.',
